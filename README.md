# Lehrstuhl App

Welcome to the Lehrstuhl-App â€“ Designed for Efficient Administration

This app has been specifically developed to optimize chair organization. It allows easy searching and filtering of theses and seminars via a text search field, as well as dropdown menus for supervisors, semesters, and research projects. With these features, you can quickly find out which theses were written in a particular semester or which supervisor is working on which project.

The Lehrstuhl-App enables the efficient management and linking of seminars, exams, staff, theses, and students. Its intuitive user interface ensures that you always have a clear overview of all relevant information.
